# Configuration file for the KL Autoencoder
# Filename convention: 
#   - autoencoder_{vae_type}_f-{downsample_factor}_d-{emb_dim}.yaml
#   - the downsample factor is determined by determined by 2^(len(ch_mults) - 1);
#     this is the number of encoder levels

### TODO start here and work on autoencoder config
